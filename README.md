# Text_Summarizer_595
Automatic text summarization is the task of producing a concise and fluent summary while
preserving key information content and overall meaning.
It can be broadly approached in two different ways:</br>
**a.)Extractive Summarization</br>**
**b.)Abstractive Summarization</br>**

In this project the abstractive approach is chosen.</br>

This type of summarization on the other hand is much more interesting than the previous. Here
we generate new sentences from the original text. In contrast to the Extractive Summarization
where we chose sentences from the text itself to form the summary, here new sentences or
words which may not be present in the original text, can be used to form the summary.
